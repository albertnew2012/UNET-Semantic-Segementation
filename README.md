# Implementation of UNET for semantic segmentation with tensorflow 2.x 

The code repo was inspired by [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf).

## Overview

### Data

The original dataset is from cityscape [leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip (11GB)](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/downloads/) 
and [gtFine_trainvaltest.zip (241MB)](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/downloads/). It contains 3500 images from multiple 
cities in Europe and comes with finely annomated labeling images. Although it is open source, you need to create an account
to download these images.


### Data augmentation
As the number of images 3500 is not large enough, thus augumentation is implemented. The images and masks are 
read in to RAM on the fly with ImageDataGenerator.


### Model

![img/u-net-architecture.png](img/u-net-architecture.png)

This deep neural network is implemented with Keras functional API, which makes it extremely easy to experiment with different interesting architectures.

Output from the network is a 256*256 which represents mask that should be learned. Softmax activation function is chosen to pick up the most 
probable classes for each pixel.


### Training

The planned number of epoch is 100. Both ModelCheckpoint and EarlyStopping are adopted to prevent overfitting. After 46 epoch, 
the trainning stopped and achieve val_accuracy of 0.91 and mIoU of 68.2


## How to use

### Dependencies

This tutorial depends on the following libraries:

* Tensorflow 2.x
* Python 3.8

### Run main.py

Before running main.py, you need to download the training and testing images from cityscape as mention above, 
unzip the data, place them in data folder. Then run create_dataset.py, this will create a data structure needed by main.py.



### Results

Use the trained model to do segmentation on test images, the result is statisfactory.
